# Hints

## 1. Define the expected time spent in the oven

- You need to define a [constant][odin-overview-constant].

## 2. Calculate the remaining oven time.

- You need to define a [procedure][odin-overview-procedure] with a single parameter.
- You can use the previously defined constant.
- You can use Odin's [mathematical operators][odin-overview-math-ops] to compute the time.

## 3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes

- You need to define a [procedure][odin-overview-procedure] with a single parameter.
- You can use Odin's [mathematical operators][odin-overview-math-ops] to compute the time.

## 4. Calculate the total working time in minutes

To know the total time it took from when you started to now, define the procedure `elapsed_time` which, given the `number_of_layers` in your lasagna and the `actual_minutes_in_oven` computes how many minutes you have spent working so far.

- You need to define a [procedure][odin-overview-procedure] with two parameters.
- You need to call a procedure you previously defined.
- You can use Odin's [mathematical operators][odin-overview-math-ops] to compute the time.
