# Tests

To run the tests from within the exercise directory, run the command:

```sh
odin test .
```

While you are testing, Odin can "vet" your code: it can look for things like unused imports and variables. Run your tests with:

```sh
odin test . -vet
```

For more options, see `odin test -help`.
