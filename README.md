# Odin

Hi!
We are happy you are here.

**exercism/odin** is one of many programming language tracks on [Exercism][exercism-website].
This repo holds the instructions, tests, code, and support files for Odin exercises currently under development or implemented and available for students.

Exercises are grouped into **practice** exercises, which are unlocked by progressing through the syllabus tree and **concept** exercises teaching the Odin syllabus, which will eventually live [here][odin-syllabus].
Practice exercises are open-ended, and can be used to practice concepts learned, try out new techniques, and _play_. These two exercise groupings can be found in the track [config.json][config-json], and under the `odin/exercises` directory.
Concept exercises are constrained to a small set of language or syntax features.

## Odin Version

The track exercises are currently compiled and tested against the release of Odin listed in [ODIN_VERSION][odin-version].

Odin is fairly stable but some minor incompatibilities still occurs from version to version. If you have a problem, try the version supported by the track, this will save you time when tracking down a problem.

## Contributing

If you are interested in contributing to the Odin track, please read our [Contributing Guide][contributing-guide].

If you are interested in contributing to the Exercism community at large, there is plenty of information on the [Building Exercism](https://exercism.org/docs/building) page.

You can also get the pulse of the community, ask questions, or provide suggestions by reading or posting to the [Exercism Forum](https://forum.exercism.org/) for general Exercism discussions or the [Odin topic on the Forum](https://forum.exercism.org/t/new-track-odin-programming-language/7379).

It might also be helpful to look at [Being a Good Community Member][being-a-good-community-member] & [The words that we use][the-words-that-we-use].

## Before You Start Writing Code or documentation

The Odin track maintainers have a set of planned features in the pipeline, the last thing we want is for you to duplicate some of the work we do being the scene and get discouraged.
If you want your contribution to be useful, make sure you coordinate with us first.
How to do this is explained in the [Contributing Guide][contributing-guide] and the [Developer FAQS][developer-faqs].

You may also find [Suggesting Exercise Improvements][suggesting-improvements] & [Chesterton's Fence][chestertons-fence] useful. 
_Thoughtful suggestions will likely result in faster & more enthusiastic responses from volunteers._
