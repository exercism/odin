## Example Nix Config

```nix
{ pkgs }:
let
  inherit (pkgs) lib;

  # TODO: Building odinfmt requires the nighly build of Odin itself
  new_pkgs = import
    (pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
      owner = "NixOS";
      repo = "nixpkgs";
      rev = "ef66aec42b5f9035a675496e9a7fe57b63505646";
      # sha256 = lib.fakeSha256;
      sha256 = "1j1ywwk1wzcd60dbam3pif8z0v695ssmm8g4aw9j01wl36pds31a";
    })
    { };

  odin = new_pkgs.odin;
in
{
  deps = [
    odin
    pkgs.ruby
    pkgs.gh

# Exercism Odin Track

[![Configlet](https://github.com/exercism/odin/actions/workflows/configlet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/exercism/odin/actions/workflows/configlet.yml) [![.github/workflows/test.yml](https://github.com/exercism/odin/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/exercism/odin/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Exercism exercises in Odin.

## Testing

To test the exercises, run `./bin/test`.
This command will iterate over all exercises and check to see if their exemplar/example implementation passes all the tests.

### Track linting

[`configlet`](https://exercism.org/docs/building/configlet) is an Exercism-wide tool for working with tracks. You can download it by running:

```shell
./bin/fetch-configlet
```

Run its [`lint` command](https://exercism.org/docs/building/configlet/lint) to verify if all exercises have all the necessary files and if config files are correct:

```shell
$ ./bin/configlet lint

The lint command is under development.
Please re-run this command regularly to see if your track passes the latest linting rules.

Basic linting finished successfully:
- config.json exists and is valid JSON
- config.json has these valid fields:
    language, slug, active, blurb, version, status, online_editor, key_features, tags
- Every concept has the required .md files
- Every concept has a valid links.json file
- Every concept has a valid .meta/config.json file
- Every concept exercise has the required .md files
- Every concept exercise has a valid .meta/config.json file
- Every practice exercise has the required .md files
- Every practice exercise has a valid .meta/config.json file
- Required track docs are present
- Required shared exercise docs are present
```
