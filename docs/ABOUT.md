# About Odin

The [Odin language][odin-website] is a statically typed, imperative language designed as a practical, modern, successor to C.
[GingerBill][gb], Odin's creator, wanted a practical language that fixes most of the C language's annoyances while still providing the same, close-to-the-metal, performance-oriented experience.

The principles of Odin:

- simplicity: consistent, safe and user-friendly syntax.
- high performance: explicit control over memory and data layout
- designed for modern systems
- bring back the joy of programming

Odin is a systems programming language in the same category as C, Go, Nim and Zig.
Unlike Go and Nim, Odin uses manual memory management: the programmer must allocate memory and then free it.
Odin's builtin mechanisms make this quite simple.

Odin's compiler suite comes with "battery included": a significant standard library and a set of game-oriented and graphics libraries such as OpenGL, SDL, Direct-X and Raylib.

Learn Odin for its promise of delivering high-performance applications with greater clarity and less friction than traditional systems languages.
