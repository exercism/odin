# About Odin

[Odin][odin] is a general-purpose programming language with distinct typing built for high performance, modern systems and data-oriented programming.
Odin is the C alternative for the Joy of Programming.

Odin was created by a games developer who became frustrated with certain aspects of C and C++, and who wanted a "better C".
The goals of Odin:

- simplicity: consistent, safe and user-friendly syntax.
- high performance: explicit control over memory and data layout
- designed for modern systems
- joy

Odin is a systems programming language in the same category as C, Go, Nim and Zig.
Unlike Go and Nim, Odin uses manual memory management: the programmer must allocate memory and then free it.
Odin provides mechanisms that make doing this quite simple.

Learn Odin for its promise of delivering high-performance applications with greater clarity and less friction than traditional systems languages.
