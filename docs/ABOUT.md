# About

The [Odin language][odin-website] is a statically typed, imperative language designed as a practical, modern, successor to C.
GingerBill, Odin's creator, wanted a practical language that fixes most of the C language's annoyances while still providing the same, close-to-the-metal, performance-oriented experience.

Odin includes additional, high-level features for data-programming, efficient memory management and comes with modern tooling.
In addition, it interfaces seamlessly with any library providing a C ABI ([Application Binary Interface][application-binary-interface]).

Odin's compiler suite comes with "battery included": a significant standard library and a set of game-oriented and graphics libraries such as OpenGL, SDL, Direct-X and Raylib.
The compiler is available on Windows, MacOS, and Linux and supports Web Assembly.

A good but short introduction to Odin can be found in this blog from Karl Zylinski, [An Introduction to Odin][introduction-to-odin]. The [Odin website][odin-website] provides a longer [overview][odin-overview].
