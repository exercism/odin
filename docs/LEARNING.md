# Learning

Odin is a systems programming language.
Like C, the programmer must manage memory manually.
Yet it is a fairly simple language.

These resources are available to help you learn Odin:

* An [Introduction to Odin][video] video, presented by Odin's creator.
* [Odin language overview][overview].
* Documentation for [official packages][packages].
* Study the [Demo File][demo], which shows, in code, concepts of Odin.
* Buy the ["Understanding the Odin Programming Language"][book] book.
* An [Introduction to Odin][intro] article, written by the author of the book.
