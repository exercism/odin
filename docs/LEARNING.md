# Learning

Odin is a systems programming language.
Like C, the programmer must manage memory manually.
Yet it is a fairly simple language.

The following resources are available to help you learn Odin:

Get a first taste of the language with:

* Watch the [Introduction to Odin][video], presented by Odin's creator.
* Read the [Introduction to Odin][intro] article, written by the author of ["Understanding the Odin Programming Language"][book].
* Study the [Demo File][demo], which shows, in code, concepts of Odin.

Dig deeper with:

* [Odin language overview][overview].
* The documentation for [official packages][packages].
* The ["Understanding the Odin Programming Language"][book] book (non-free).
* The official set of ["Odin Examples"][examples].
