# How to Check the Odin Track Status

If you are working on the Odin Track and wants to get useful status information, you can use Exercism built-in Track Management page.

To display the page, go to the Odin track, right click on the three dot to the right (on the track banner, not the top-level Exercism banner).

![Track Management Page][track-management-page]

This will display useful statistics on the track such as how many students are enrolled, which tools are provided and their status.
This can be used if you are looking for areas of improvements.
