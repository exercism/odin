# Why only one exercise per Pull Request?

If you submit a Pull Request with more than one exercise, we will reject it and ask you to split it up.
Why are we doing this? 

- It makes the reviewer job more manageable (smaller amount of code to review) and increase the chance we will provide you with good feedback.
- Changes we ask you to make for one exercise will not cause other exercises you contribute to be stuck in limbo.
- You get more Exercism reputation points this way.
- You can work on multiple exercises in parallel (just keep each exercise in its separate branch)
