# Developer Folder

This folder hosts material solely used by the track developers.

The `docs` folder includes instructions on how to build exercises and documentation.
It also holds design decisions and their rationale to help future contributors understand how the track is organized and why.

The `tools` folder includes additional tooling used in the generation and linting of the exercises and documentation, and other tools specific to the Odin track.
