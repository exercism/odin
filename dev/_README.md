# Developer Folder

This folder hosts material solely used by the track developers.

The `docs` folder includes instructions on how to build exercises and documentation.
It also holds design decisions and their rationale so that future contributors can understand how the track is organized and why.

The `tools` folder includes additional tooling used in the generation and linting of the exercises or the documentation as well as any other tool specific to the Odin track.
They are located here to keep the `bin` directory tidy and because Odin programs require a separate folder structure.
There will typically be a bash script in the `bin` folder to call them with the correct set of parameters.
